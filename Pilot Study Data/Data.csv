Some experience,Robotics Student,High,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Comfortable,Somewhat unsafe,Somewhat unsafe,Somewhat safe,Uncomfortable,Very Unintuitive,Unintuitive,Intuitive,Yes,Using the headset for extended periods of time would be most uncomfortable. There is the sensation of eye stain and overheating. It is always a relief to take it off. The experience is tolerable. ,Discomfort manifested itself mainly when the robot proceeded to pass around me past my field of vision. The robot moved around very close to me. Seeing the path the robot was going to take reassured me of its intentions.,The resolution and the physical fit are the main factors that influence my comfort. ,"Seeing the position marker of the robot with XR helps with establish an intuition regarding the robot's positional self-awareness. Seeing the path in XR takes this to the next level. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the robustness of the system. Without XR, it is assumed that the robot will try to pass around me without hitting me but there is no evidence that this will happen. ",Seeing the robot's intended trajectory is the only parameter that significantly influenced my sense of safety. Otherwise XR vs no XR are equivalent. ,"The robot moved very close to my feet and navigated around my back. This is when I felt the most unsafe. However, seeing the path helped reassure me that the robot was not planning any even more invasive actions. ",
No experience,Robotics Student,High,Uncomfortable,Neutral,Comfortable,Neutral,Neutral,Somewhat safe,Very Comfortable,Neutral,Neutral,Intuitive,No,,Without the XR headset I took a narrower stance and was unaware of the robot's movements. With the headset I took a wider stance without realising it in the moment but was still hesitant to the robot's movements. With the path visual I was much more comfortable and took an even wider stance (again without thinking about it). It was good to see the path of the robot.,The passthrough of the headset is great. It is lightweight. The headset could maybe be more breathable (for the skin).,"Sometimes the robot did not take a wide-enough detour around me. This could be due to my legs being further than shoulder width apart. The robot, on one of the runs, switched direction and went around me to my left rather than my right (in the task where I walked in front of the robot) and this took me by surprise in the moment, although it is a very natural movement to do.",Knowing the trajectory of the robot helped understand it's intentions. Robot's typically do not follow social norms when moving so it was comforting to know the robot's plan.,"The robot brushed my shoe (no force, just barely touched) at one point as it attempted to go around me. This was an unsettling moment but the robot then went around me at a bigger distance. This incident occured whilst wearing the headset, without path visual, although I believe this was just the robot's path planning.",

I was not sure what they were for?
Some experience,Physics Student,Mid,Comfortable,Neutral,Comfortable,Somewhat safe,Neutral,Somewhat safe,Comfortable,Neutral,Unintuitive,Very Intuitive,Yes,,"For the task where I stood in the path of Tiago stationary, I:
Without XR: Felt like Tiago was capable of stopping at any time and was not too close to me
With XR (no PV): Felt like Tiago was very close to me, warped screen vision made it harder to judge distance (I assume this was due to parallax and focusing on the 2D screen)
With XR (with PV): Felt like Tiago was an acceptable distance away, and seeing its change in pathways helped to indicate which direction it was taking and what I could assume it was deciding on.

For the task where I stood in the path of Tiago by intercepting, I:
Without XR: Felt like Tiago stopped far too late, but after, was able to safely manoeuvre away get to its target with space away from me
With XR (no PV): Felt like Tiago stopped far too late, warped screen vision made it harder to judge distance (I assume this was due to parallax and focusing on the 2D screen), and manoeuvring around me was far too close
With XR (with PV): Felt like Tiago stopped an acceptable distance away, yet was very close with how it manoeuvred around me afterwards, it could've retraced its steps and found a further away route around the other side of me

This is independent of the actions it took, just how it was easy it was to tell the direction chosen","Yes, with no path visualisation on the XR, it was harder to tell spatial dimensions and the understanding about the path the robot intended to take","Stopping time was too long when Yes XR No PV Intercept task was taken place, felt extremely close","Though it would have taken longer, the robot could be more safer and easier to understand if it allowed backtracking to visualise alternatives"

With XR (visual path) this didn't help reduce the instant discomfort of when tiago was too close to me after I jumped in, because at that time the path disappeared from my front view, as it have been replanned and mapped to my rear view. With XR the instants of discomfort are reduced as I cannot see the robot at all angles around me when it was too close.",It was light,,"Yes, I think I can see at shorter field of view with the headset ","yes when the robot was too close to me at multiple instants without headset, and at the instant of jumping in his path with headset (visual/no visual path) as the path disappeared from my view at that moment.","More scenarios with diverse trajectories can help get more insights on the benefits of wearing the headset. Also, experiments are better to be conducted by both people used to work/interacting with the robot and those who are not."
